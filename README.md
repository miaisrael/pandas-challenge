# PyCitySchools
Well done! Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. In your latest role, you've become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
Your final report should include each of the following:

## District Summary

Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

    Total Schools
    Total Students
    Total Budget
    Average Math Score
    Average Reading Score
    % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## School Summary

Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

    School Name
    School Type
    Total Students
    Total School Budget
    Per Student Budget
    Average Math Score
    Average Reading Score
    % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:

    School Name
    School Type
    Total Students
    Total School Budget
    Per Student Budget
    Average Math Score
    Average Reading Score
    % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.


## Math Scores by Grade

Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


## Reading Scores by Grade

Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


## Scores by School Spending

Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:

    Average Math Score
    Average Reading Score
    % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


## Scores by School Size

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).


## Scores by School Type

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).



# Description of Trends

The last three dataframes in this report illustrate some trends from these data that highlight how student scores vary based on certain school-level factors. School performance across math and reading scores is actually worse as the per student spending increases- this is surprising since funding is usually tied to better school performance. However, these data trend towards worse school performance (based on math and reading scores) as school size increases and among district schools compared to charter schools. These trends are less surprising to those who have worked in education.
